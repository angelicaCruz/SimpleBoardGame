# SimpleBoardGame
This project is an example usage of METool kit. 

**SCENARIO**
Two devices share the same scene and interact with a common object: the **Grid**.

Two devices stand for two players: Player A colors the blocks of the grid with blue while Player B uses color green to color the blocks. 
At every turn, only one player can interact with the scene. You can change it if you want to. 

**Note:**
- Before getting started, download [**METookit**](https://github.com/DataMesh-OpenSource/METoolkit "METoolkit Source"). 
- This project is created with the older version on METool kit, so make sure you're not using the METool kit 2017 version.

### Get Started
Get started by integrating **METool kit** with your Unity project. This can be done in two different ways. 
1. Unzip the folder. Go to Unity, click **Open** and select the unzipped file. 
2. You can create a new project then drag and drop the METool kit folder in the **Project** section in Unity. 

To configure your project correctly, follow [**Configuration manual**](http://docs.datamesh.com/projects/me-live/en/latest/toolkit/toolkit-man-configure-your-project/ "Project Config"). 

Find **_scene_** and have as you main scene. In the project panel, find **MEHoloEntrance** then drag and drop it in the Heirarchy. It is important that you have this in your scene as this manages all the modules of the METool kit: Cursors, Inputs and Collaboration in this scenario. Follow [**Integration manual**](http://docs.datamesh.com/projects/me-live/en/latest/toolkit/toolkit-man-integrated-METoolkit/ "Integration Manual") for a correct integration of the tool kit.
