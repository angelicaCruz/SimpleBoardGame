# SimpleBoardGame
This project is an example usage of METool kit. 

**SCENARIO**
Two devices share the same scene and interact with a common object: the **Grid**.

Two devices stand for two players: Player A colors the blocks of the grid with blue while Player B uses color green to color the blocks. 
At every turn, only one player can interact with the scene. You can change it if you want to. 

**Note:**
- Before getting started, download [**METookit**](https://github.com/DataMesh-OpenSource/METoolkit "METoolkit Source"). 
- This project is created with the older version on METool kit, so make sure you're not using the METool kit 2017 version.
