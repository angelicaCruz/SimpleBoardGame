This project is an example usage of METool kit. 

**SCENARIO**
Two devices share the same scene and interact with a common object: the **Grid**.

Two devices stand for two players: Player A colors the blocks of the grid with blue while Player B uses color green to color the blocks. 
At every turn, only one player can interact with the scene. You can change it if you want to.
